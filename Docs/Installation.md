   ```bash
   cd http-request-inspector
   ```
3. Install dependencies for the server:

   cd server
   npm install
   ```
4. Open another terminal and Install dependencies for the client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the server:

    const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';
   const FRONTEND_URL = 'http://localhost:5173/';

   module.exports = {
       BACKEND_URL,
      FRONTEND_URL,
   };
    ```

Now, you are good to go.
